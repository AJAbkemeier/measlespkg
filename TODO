More important:
- Fix round_round.fit_results so it updates traces correctly
 - Need to figure out how to modify panelPomp traces
- Edit eval_logLik to make the return the pfilter object for a *good* fit
  instead of the last one
- Edit eval_logLik to return an array of many conditional log likelihoods

Less imporant:

- Continue to think of ways to make the package easy to use and understand
- Figure out how to stop Csnippet code from getting flattened after installation
 - Alternatively, figure out how to display contents of model_mechanics better

Optional:
- Standardize how output directory is structured
 - Design the structure to make things more organized and to make sharing easier
 - Figure out a way to enforce the structure
- Turn generalPanelFit.R into an .Rmd file and think about how to make the
  knitted output look nice with easily-located results (possibly with a button
  to skip to results?)
