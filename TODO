- Figure out how to stop Csnippet code from getting flattened after installation
 - Alternatively, figure out how to display contents of model_mechanics better
- Fix round_round.fit_results so it updates traces correctly
 - Need to figure out how to modify panelPomp traces
- Standardize how output directory is structured
 - Design the structure to make things more organized and to make sharing easier
 - Figure out a way to enforce the structure
- Turn generalPanelFit.R into an .Rmd file and think about how to make the
  knitted output look nice with easily-located results (possibly with a button
  to skip to results?)
- Continue to think of ways to make the package easy to use and understand
- Write code to use spatPomp
- Update duplicate_top_pparams to work with values of top_n that do not divide
  out_length
