\arguments{
\item{model_obj}{Model object to evaluate log likelihood of.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use for parallel computing.}

\item{np_pf}{Number of particles to use.}

\item{nreps}{Number of particle filter repetitions.}

\item{seed}{Seed for particle filter. If NULL, does not set new seed.}

\item{divisor}{seed mod divisor*i is used to obtain seed for ith repetition.
If NULL, does not set new seed.}

\item{return_pfilter_obj}{Should the returned list include a pfilter object?
repetition. If NULL, pfilter object is not saved.}

\item{print_time}{Should time to run pfilter be printed?}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned, but several files are saved.
